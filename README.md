While working on research regarding the Response of Convective Storms Moving Through the Chicago Region, it was important to gather ten years worth of radar data in order to analyze the various patterns observed and to find out which variables affected the response of the storms. Since a lot of clicking and website navigation was involved initially in the data gathering process, I programmed this script. 

This program uses selenium to webscrape the source of the data (https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/imagearchive/). 

By looking through the HTML and backbone of the website, I assembled various componenets in the code to expedite the process. The dates.txt file was written using code after providing the template file. Using these dates, it was possible to navigate the site using a change in url. For faster entry of data, hotkeys were implemented which would enable the corresponding GIFs to slow down, speed up, reverse, pause, continue, and move to the next or previous date(s).
